Description:
TOC: qna

# Question:

I am supposed to draw a transparent sphere which can be rotated by mouse dragging. I tried to start learning the basis of WebGl but I have not found any appropriate sources. Can anybody help me how to start learning WebGl and also how to draw 3D shapes such as Sphere or tetrahedron and how I can spin it in all dimensions ?
Thanks.

I'd recommend you use [three.js](http://threejs.org) but if you really want to learn WebGL start with http://webglfundamentals.org ;)
