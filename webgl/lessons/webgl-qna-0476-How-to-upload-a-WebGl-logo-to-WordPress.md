Title: How to upload a WebGl logo to WordPress
Description:
TOC: qna

# Question:

I have generated WebGl files of my logo, and I want to upload it to my WordPress site.

I tried embedding it in iframe with no success, any ideas?

# Answer

is it your own hosted site or something on wordpress.com?

I put webgl on my wordpress site all the time (or have in the past) with just

    <iframe src="/path/to/webgl-thing.html" width="500" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen />
