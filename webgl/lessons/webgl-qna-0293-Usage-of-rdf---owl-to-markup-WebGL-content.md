TOC: qna

# Question:

i have given scene in webGL of a pizza for example. Now i want to make the content in the scene semantic  visible for maschines with a custom owl and rdf for example.

When i make a owl ontologie with protege can i just use this ontology like here
https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/146898 and instead of linking to
http://rdf.data-vocabulary.org/# i link to my own ontology and use my properties, tags etc. ?



# Answer

WebGL is an API. Any data is outside the scope of WebGL. There is nothing to markup or add any ontology to.

Maybe you're looking for something like [X3DOM](http://www.x3dom.org/)?
