# Question:

We are using WEBGL to render OBJ models . What is the best approach to protect these assets.
or at least make it difficult for someone to pull out the obj mesh . source.
There has been few threads discussing this issue but most of them confined to rudimentary ways like disabling right click on browser etc.

Any suggestions please

# Answer

What's the best approach on any other platform? I can stick the CD or DVD from any console game in my PC and read the files directly off the disc. I can look at any files installed on my PC games. I can back up the apps on my iOS or Android devices and read those files on my PC. What do you expect to be different in WebGL?
